# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This repository centralizes OctoAcme's project management processes — clear, versioned, and collaborative guidance for delivery teams. Use this README as a quick entry point to find process documentation, roles, and playbooks used across projects.

## Process overview

OctoAcme practices customer-centered, iterative, and data-informed project management. Key principles:
- Clear ownership and responsibilities
- Regular, timeboxed syncs and status updates
- Proactive risk identification and mitigation
- Continuous improvement via retrospectives and stakeholder feedback

## Project management flow

1. Initiation — define the problem, stakeholders, goals, success metrics, and constraints.  
2. Planning — break work into trackable increments, estimate effort, and identify dependencies and acceptance criteria.  
3. Execution &amp; tracking — use project boards, standups, and dashboards to monitor progress, quality, and risks.  
4. Release &amp; deployment — follow release playbooks with rollbacks and incident runbooks.  
5. Retrospectives — capture learnings and action items after milestones and releases.
