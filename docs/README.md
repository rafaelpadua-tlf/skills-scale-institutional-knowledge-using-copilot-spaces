OctoAcme runs projects through a lightweight, iterative lifecycle that begins with a Project One‑pager (problem, goal, success metrics) and moves through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Planning turns approved initiatives into a prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria, estimates, a Definition of Done, and a release/milestone map. Day‑to‑day work is coordinated on a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and delivered via small, CI‑backed pull requests that link to issues and acceptance criteria to keep changes traceable and reviewable.

Work is organized around defined personas with clear ownership: Product Managers (define outcomes and prioritize), Project Managers (coordinate delivery, risks, and communication), Developers (implement and test), QA (validate acceptance), and stakeholders (inputs and approvals). Planning artifacts (one‑pager, backlog items, DoD, risk register) and role responsibilities ensure each increment is shippable and that cross‑team dependencies have named owners and mitigations.

Communication is structured into a predictable cadence: daily standups for blockers and progress, weekly delivery syncs and PM/PdM alignment, demos at the end of sprints or milestones, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risks and dependencies are logged in a Risk Register and reviewed weekly; the docs provide templates for weekly status updates and incident communications. Escalation follows a tiered path (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) with explicit guidance to follow the security incident runbook for security issues.

Quality assurance is enforced in multiple layers: developers write unit and integration tests, CI runs linting, tests and security scans before review, and end‑to‑end smoke tests validate critical flows pre‑release. PR guidance favors small changes (<=400 lines), at least one approval before merge, and inclusion of acceptance criteria. The release process includes pre‑release checks (passing CI, release notes, rollback plan, smoke tests), a deployment checklist, and a rollback/incident playbook. Continuous improvement is closed‑looped via retrospectives that produce tracked action items added back to the backlog.
